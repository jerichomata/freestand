Frontend

1. 
2. Add logout functionality
3. When user signs up take them through sign up pages
   When backend is set up:

- Category listings page needs to be dynamically loaded from database
- Featured profiles on home page needs to be dynamic somehow

Low priority:
mobile responsiveness of everything, including categories bar
