Frontend

1. Make Profile Page component
2. Add button and link functionality to what I can
3. Login sequence (firebase?)
   When backend is set up:

- Category listings page needs to be dynamically loaded from database
- Featured profiles on home page needs to be dynamic somehow

Low priority:
mobile responsiveness of everything, including categories bar
